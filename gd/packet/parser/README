This file just contains some notes about the design and usage of the PDL language.

-------
 TERMS
-------
.pdl
  The file type that defines packet definitions. You may think of each pdl file
  as its own translation unit.

Packet Views and Builders
  Generated from a packet definition. Views are used to validate packets and
  extract the fields that are defined in the pdl file.  Builders check the input
  arguments and can be serialized.

-------------
 LIMITATIONS
-------------
  - Size fields for a variable length field MUST come before the definition
    of said field.

  - Payload fields must be byte-aligned unless they have an unknown size.
    Body fields are allowed to not be byte aligned.

  - No conditionals

  - Can not have to fields with the same name anywhere in the in an inheritence chain

  - Can't handle size for Body type fields yet since they might not be byte aligned.

-------
 NOTES
-------
All Field names should be in CamelCase. Field names matching type names is supported.

The payload keyword generates a getter but body doesn't. Therefore, a payload must be byte aligned.
Supports constraints on grandparents
Supports multiple constraints
Every field handles its own generation.
One pdl file will result in one header file with all the packets

Things to cover -
  Constraints
  Inheritence vs Contains
